# Cypher's Custom CommandHelper Scripts

Years ago I made some scripts in [CommandHelper](https://methodscript.com) to help in running a Minecraft server, and generally have fun with a coding project.  
These are now uploaded here for your perusal.  

## Releases
I've updated a few of the scripts to be compatible with latest CH 3.3.5 version / Minecraft 1.19, along with new features as well!  
You'll find those in the Releases folder.  

#### Development Releases
Various scripts have been getting updates lately along with major changes and new features, but aren't yet ready for a full release. Check out all that's available in the dev folder!  

#### Older Scripts
Older versions for 3.3.1 / 3.3.2 or earlier CH builds can be found in their own folder under Releases.  
(Some scripts in dev folder are also in various unfinished states, but might be worth fixing.)
