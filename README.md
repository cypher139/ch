Custom CommandHelper Scripts
==
Years ago I made some scripts in CommandHelper to help in running a Minecraft server, and generally have fun with a coding project. 
These are now uploaded here for your perusal. 
Note that scripts have not been tested to work past Minecraft 1.8 (or whenever the dual-wielding 'off hand' feature was added).
Some scripts in dev enviroment while silly are also unfinished, might be worth fixing.
