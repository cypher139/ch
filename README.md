# Cypher's Custom CommandHelper Scripts

Years ago I made some scripts in [CommandHelper](https://methodscript.com) to help in running a Minecraft server, and generally have fun with a coding project.  
These are now uploaded here for your perusal.  

## Releases
I've updated a few of the scripts to be compatible with latest CH 3.3.5 version / Minecraft 1.19, you'll find those in the Releases folder.  

#### Older Scripts
Note that some scripts have not been tested to work past CH 3.3.1 / Minecraft 1.8 (or whenever the dual-wielding 'off hand' feature was added).  
Some scripts in dev folder are also in various unfinished states, but might be worth fixing.
