todo:
- stats: show when item data is used
- admins: unbind another players tool. If this was an admin who performed the unbind command, lock out tool usage for that player until re-login?
-admin lock or unlock a spamming player's access to tool. if locked all modes are disabled for that player until an admin performs /rladmin unlock
-support to empty instead of fill.
-economy support. charge per fill, charge more for area. charge a lot for random.
- economy - "item". enabled if a setting is set, or default for missing access to CHVault extension. Will take specified item from players inventory, in lieu of charging a fee.
-randomizer - set all contents in an area to have random objects in each inventory slot, also most slots will have nothing at all. useful for survival games.

#reload random
#meant to be called once per block, for area needs re called for each successful block - _iterate_cuboid can manage this
#acts as wrapper for fill, managing random - whether or not it calls it.
#first get block types that can be used array
#2: assign action, yes or no. 50/50.
#if nothing, return(nofilled
#if yes continues
#3: assign choices, high percentage of nothing! each block/item to fill gets a weight. highest weight goes to nothing.
#if block, iterate inventory slots. send _reloader_fill the needed information to fill the slot if something was chosen. - must retrofit to not fill entire slots, only a specific slot.
#for stats you must return what / how much was filled.
