ReLoad version 1.0-tza
Main features Added:
- Added redirect aliases to commands that may accidentally be used by players intending to use ReLoad, and also convienence aliases.
	--- /reload or /rl redirects to the main /reloader command, instead of reloading server. Console can still use /reload, but needs to type /reload now.
	*********It is highly recommended that you stop and restart your server, rather than reload it.***********
	--- /none will unbind ReLoad tool if is bound, otherwise redirects to WorldEdit's /none to unbind a WE tool.
- Added version value into script, for potential use in troubleshooting. Use /reloaderadmin version to view the script version installed.
- Added default item specifically for Fuel mode. This should prevent accidentally trying to use Arrows - the normal default item - to fill as fuel.
- Added nag messages for installing CH extensions required by this script.
- Added aliases to serveral action commands. Examples: a for Area mode, ? for help, mode d for setting area mode to dispenser.

- Features Upgraded:
- Renamed script name to distinguish from the original DLoad script.
	-- The command name has changed to /reloader. All permissions also now reference 'reloader' instead of 'dload'.
- Changed persistance ID structure for the Tool function to save using the tool ID number (eg Diamond Pickaxe = 278). 
	-- This means that multiple tools at once can now be used, and each tool has its own item & quantity settings.
	-- Unbinding all tools currently requires a separate operation for each tool, or use /reloadaliases to clear all import/export values for CH.
- You can now undo a tool unbind. (A pleasant side effect of the tool ID change!) Use /reloader managebind, or the shortcut /none undo .
	-- Note: Undo history for the tool is lost on 1)Server restart 2)/reloadaliases 3)Re-binding tool using new settings - aka using the main /reloader command.
- Changed persistance ID structure to move the playername further into the id (eg ReLoad.player.PLAYERNAME.setting instead of PLAYERNAME.ReLoad.setting).
	-- This allows for easier manual searching of any player-specific value in the Persistance database, or easier deleting of all of players saved values.
- Changed "yes/no" commands to a toggle function - no more yes or no is required
- Moved WorldEdit selection functions calls (And the area iteration procedure that requires the selection) to isolated .ms files.
	-- This allows /reloader and the backend functions to compile if the SKCompat extension is missing, by only loading the file with potentially "unknown functions to the Java Interpreter" if the SKCompat extension exists. 
	-- Note that Area mode requires a WE selection, so if the required extension is not detected Area mode will be disabled.
- Changed if() actions to a cleaner switch() action selector, Allows for aliases to actions!
- Moved reassigning of user option variables for the /reloader tool function to later in the command; this removes the need for the hardcoded actions check and allows for aliases to actions.

- Bugfixes:
- Bugfix: Added assigning of numerous out-of-scope variables into the correct scope.
	-- These variables were preventing correct compilation on newer CH builds equipped with the stricter compiler.
- Changed several "yes" or "no" values to report a much cleaner true/false.
- Removed duplicate variables in use that just pointed to player()
- Bugfix: When enabling tool, useless and incomplete last run stats were unnecessarily saved.  
	-- This ended up causing an exception if these stats were viewed before a new ReLoad run (area or tool) was performed to overwrite the bad last run statistic.
- Added exception handler into each command, to clean up the display of an error message if one gets displayed on screen. The console will still get all the original message's data (albeit reformatted).
- Bugfix: A bound tool that was set in Fuel mode also filled chest or dispensers when clicked on. Fuel mode is now restricted to furnaces.
- Bugfix: When attempting to use a previously set item type with item data, script erroneously activated an auto fix for bad item id number, which changed the set item type to default.

todo:
- stats: show when item data is used
- admins: unbind another players tool. If this was an admin who performed the unbind command, lock out tool usage for that player until re-login?
-admin lock or unlock a spamming player's access to tool. if locked all modes are disabled for that player until an admin performs /rladmin unlock
-support to empty instead of fill.
-economy support. charge per fill, charge more for area. charge a lot for random.
- economy - "item". enabled if a setting is set, or default for missing access to CHVault extension. Will take specified item from players inventory, in lieu of charging a fee.
-randomizer - set all contents in an area to have random objects in each inventory slot, also most slots will have nothing at all. useful for survival games.
