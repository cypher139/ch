Generates a random code on demand!

Usage:

 Call _codegen(NUMBER, character type 1, character type 2) in your script.
 The number determines how long the code is, and the 2 types determine which types of characters you want. 
 Character types: lowercase ("lower"), uppercase ("upper"), number ("num"), or all.

/codegen = Prints a randomly generated code to you.
