Expbank **version 1.0**
ExpBank: Deposit or withdraw experience levels using signs!

Notes on why this version is no longer supported:

- This version records all values in internal database by sign coordinates rather than accounts.
	- This means stored xp levels are only available at the sign it was deposited on and awarded if sign destroyed.

- Full levels are used & not total XP, which may open up duping issues by a player storing level 1 transactions many many times then withdrawing to high levels.

Untested past CH 3.3.1 and Minecraft 1.8.
